Instead of "Name" field in "Classes", should it have "Department" and "CourseNumber"?
	Example: "ENGT4050" -> "ENGT", "4050"

Timestamps?

Option to ask question one at a time?  Option for real time quizzes where teacher can decide when to display 'next' question?

Option to add weights to quizzes? That lets teachers make a quiz worth 20 percent of a students grade without having to weight each question.

Quiz database:

StudentResponse, or QuestionAttempt table
	"AnswerID", "StudentID", "QuestionID" fields.
	Added to database when student submits a quiz.

QuizAttempt(?) table
	When student submits a quiz, an entry in this table is created.
	Fields are "PointsPossible", "PointsScored", "StudentID", "QuizID"
	Querys are done to determine which questions in the quiz the student answered correctly.
	The "PointsPossible" and "PointsScored" fields are populated.

When students view or teacher views a students grades, a students QuizAttempts are totaled and math is done to show the students grade.

For partial credit, instead of "IsCorrect" field in "Answers", it could be replaced with "PartialCredit" which could be 0 for wrong, 1 for correct, 0.5 for partial, etc.
"PointValue" in "Questions" could then be renamed to "MaxPointValue"
This model would work better with non multiple choice questions in the future?

Should unanswered questions be allowed?
In SAT tests, you can leave a question blank.  You are also penalized 0.25% of the questions value if you choose a wrong answer.  (Designed to stop people from guessing)
